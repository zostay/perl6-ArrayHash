    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKING: Previously, this class has accepted named
      arguments as hash items to add to the array-hash or multi-hash. However,
      this is not Raku-ish. From now on, elements must be added via positional
      arguments. If the arguments are Pairs, the Pairs will be added directly.
      If the items are not Pairs, they should be provided as an evenly numbered
      list of items that will be made into Pairs. A similar change has been made
      for all methods, such as .push. See documentation for details.
    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKING: (Maybe.) Some methods which previously returns
      List now return Seq, e.g., values, keys, kv, etc.
    * Methods that are both hashish and arrayish may have a :array/:hash adverb
      selector to allow you to choose which version of the method to use. The
      default is usually :hash if not specified.
    * Bugfix: If multi-hash('a' => 1, 'a' => 2).[0]:delete occured, the hash
      side of the multi-hash would no longer mirror the state of the array side.
      This then triggered a post-condition failure.
